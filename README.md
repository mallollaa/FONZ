I know you will ask WHAT IS THIS ?

Helllooo First of all secound I've created this scrapite to make my life easier :)

Hereâ€™s how it works:

It starts by checking and matching KAM names from our list
Next, it filters out the names to focus on those with 'FONZ' only
It then organizes the data according to the 'EventType'
The filtered data will be copied into a new Excel file where sheets are created for each event type.

I've applied calculations for 'Package Price', 'Slab', and 'Commission' specifically for the 'Gross Add' event to ensure everything runs smoothly
I've done it on 'Gross Add' to make sure it process as needed before rolling it out for other events and after getting your feedback of course!

Pull it, test it and let mee knoww!
